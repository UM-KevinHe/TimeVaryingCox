Description: An implementation of fitting the Cox model with time-varying coefficients. It utilizes the  
    block-wise steepest ascent algorithm proposed by He et al. (2020) and the Newton-Raphson algorithm to
    minimize the partial likelihood. It also contains a simulation function that generates survival data 
    based on a time-varying coefficient model.
